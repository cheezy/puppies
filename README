== Puppies example application

This is an example application that I am developing to use in an ATDD course as well
as my book.

Once you download (clone) the project you will need to ensure you have all of the necessary gems.  You can do this by executing:

    bundle

in the puppies directlry.  After this command completes you can start the application by executing:

    rails s

This will start the application.  Simply point your browser at http://localhost:3000 and you should see the puppy appliation.
